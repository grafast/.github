# Gra*fast*

Gra*fast* is an exciting new execution engine for GraphQL that enables greater
efficiency across your entire backend stack by leveraging query planning.

The source code for the TypeScript implementation of Gra*fast* is currently in
the `/grafast/grafast` folder of the [Graphile Crystal
monorepo](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/tree/main/grafast/grafast); this enables
faster feedback on changes due to the integration tests of the related
projects. For Gra*fast* version 1.0 we plan to build a specification, and a
reference implementation in a different programming language.

In the mean time, this organization hosts [the Gra*fast* working
group](https://github.com/grafast/wg) for anyone interested in getting involved
in the future of Gra*fast*.
